# Medicalily

## Description
Approximately 12 million people are affected by medical diagnostic errors in the United States each year, with women and minorities being disproportionately affected. It is an issue that requires scrutinizing the current infrastructure without undermining the patient's trust in the medical system. Medicalily strives to use the power of crowdsourcing to create a database of symptoms and diagnoses to keep medical providers and patients informed. We are aiming to create a community-driven aggregation of resources that can allow patients to remain aware of topics regarding their health.

## Technical Overview
The application is structured in the client server model, with CockroachDB as the general purpose database, Express.js as the backend framework, and React Native for the frontend.
